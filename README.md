# Networked Data Lab: NDL North West London satellite project on Clinically Extremely Vulnerable (CEV) people

#### Project Status: Completed

## Project Description

- This Networked Data Lab analysis focusses on clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) people, also known as the shielding population - the group of people most at risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19. This group were asked to not leave their homes and to minimise all face-to-face contact up until the end of July 2020 in most of the UK. Whilst the shielding guidance was paused over Summer, people were once again asked to minimise their contact with others from November.

- We are using a federated approach to data analysis and each partner will be contributing the same descriptive analysis based on their local population. These results will then be analysed and aggregated where necessary.

- This is the repository for the NDL North West London satellite analysis.  

## Data sources

This analysis utilised the Discover dataset, which is accessible via the Discover-NOW Health Data Research Hub for Real World Evidence through their data scientist specialists and IG committee-approved analysts, hosted by Imperial College Health Partners.

### Requirements

These scripts were written in R version 4.0.2 and RStudio Version 1.1.383.
